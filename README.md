# Wwise Unreal Generate Gamesyncs Data Table [Deprecated]

> This repository is deprecated since current versions of the Wwise SDK plugin for Unreal allow for Switches and States to be usable assets.

Improved string handling for Wwise nodes when working in Unreal blueprints. Creates a data table for gamesyncs (RTPC, Switches, States) in the Unreal project. Works alongside a UE Structure to determine the data type of the CSV row.

> Note: This script is in no way tied to working with the Unreal Engine. It just creates a .csv file that Unreal can use. You could use this script to create a .csv for any other purpose, such as with another engine (Unity, CryEngine, GameMaker Studio, etc.)

> Below just illustrates how this script is used to solve a workflow problem with Wwise and Unreal

## Wwise Gamesyncs and Unreal Engine Wwise Bluprint Nodes
As an audio designer, one thing that has frustrated me when working with Wwise and Unreal Blueprints is renaming.

Typically, when a switch or state should be renamed, each Wwise node in Unreal where that switch or state has been called also needs to be renamed.

#### Wwise Nodes in Unreal

* The problematic pipeline: 

  - Rename Gamesyncs In Wwise -> Generate SoundBanks -> UE4 Shows No Errors -> Rename At Each Wwise Node In UE4 Blueprints -> Possible Missed Renamed Nodes

However, if we could get the gamesync names and group names from a data table, we would only need to update the data table each time SoundBanks are generated. And if a new data table were to be generated using a script, we would be able massively increase effiency of the renaming process.

* Our pipeline becomes:
  - Rename Gamesyncs In Wwise -> Generate SoundBanks -> Generate Data Table -> UE4 Asks To Recompile -> Double Check Blueprints

# Using This Script
This script is designed to be placed in the same folder as the Soundbanks.xml file in your project. 

When run, the script will read the XML data in the Soundbanks.xml file, convert to an untangle element, then create a .csv file with all the data formatted for UE4.

#### The Part of the XML Containing the Gamesync Data

Then, a UE4 Structure file will be used to define the data types for each column of the data table

Finally, the technical audio designer can call the 'Get Data Table Row' node and use a drop-down menu to select the data table and a drop-down menu to select the gamesync. The row of the data table is the same name as the gamesync the audio designer wishes to use. By dragging out from the 'Out Row' pin, the audio designer can get the gamesync group and name, which can then be connected to the Wwise 'Set Switch' node.

* Whenever significant renaming needs to happen, just run the script and update the data table

## UNIX Executable: Using a Bash Script to Run the Python Script
To avoid opening a Python IDE everytime to run the script, a UNIX Exeutable can be used instead. 

Create a new .txt file and enter the following:

> Note: You can used 'cd' to change to the .py file directory and 'python3 "FileNameHere.py"' to run
```
#!/bin/bash

cd `pwd`'/Documents/Unreal Projects/---PATH TO PROJECT---'

echo 'Opening file: "Wwise Generate Gamesyncs Datatable.py"'

python3 'Wwise Generate Gamesyncs Datatable.py'

killall Terminal
```

Then close the file, delete the '.txt' extension from the filename, open Terminal (or command prompt)

'cd' to where the .txt file was and run
```
chmod 744 '---filename---'
```
Where '---filename---' is the name of your file
